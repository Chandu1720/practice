What is operators and types of operators?
opereators are speial keyword or symbols that performs the opereations on values(oprands)
there differnt types of operators supported by js
 unary binary ternary 
        1.Arthamatic operators
        2.Assignment operators
        3.Comparasion operators
        4.Logical operators
        5.Bitwise operators
        7.types operators
        8.string operators
        9.nullish operator
1.Arthamatic operators:
    arthamatic operators performs  arthamatic operations like addition ,subtraction ,multiplication and division and modules
    1.addition(+):it performs  the addtion and retuns the sum of two values
        ex:operand1+operand2
    2.sub(-):It subtracts the right-hand value from the left-hand value and returns the result.
        ex: operand1-operand2
    3.mul(*):it performs mul operation and returns the product of two values
        ex:operand1*operand2
    4.div(/):It divides the left-hand value by the right-hand value and returns the quotient.
        ex:operand1/operand2
    5.modules(%):It returns the remainder after dividing the left-hand value by the right-hand value.
        ex:operand1%operand2
    
    ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
    1. =  Assign it assigns the value to the variables
    2. += it will add and assign
    3. -= it will subtract and assign
    4. *= it will multiply and assign
    5. /= it will dived and assign
    6. %= it will modules and assign

    COMPARASATION OPERATORS : returns only boolean values( true or false)
    1.  == : it means equal to compares both value are equal or not it neglates datatype It performs type coercion 
    2. === : it is same as equal to but it dont performs type coercion but it compares bothvalue and data type
    3. >:it means greterthan it compares the left hand value is greterthan right hand value
    4. <:it means less than it compares the left-hand value is lower than right-hand value
    5. >=it means greter than equalsto it compares left-hand value is greater than are equalsto right-handvalue 
    6. <=it means less than equalsto it compares left-hand value is lower than are equalsto right-handvalue 
    7. != it means that right hand value should not equal to left hand value
    8. !== it means that right  hand value stirctly not equal to left hand value 
    
Logical operators
 1.AND(&&): it workes on truth table like if both values are true then it returns true otherwise it returns false
 2.OR(||): it is also workes on truth table if any value is true it returns true otherwise false
 3.NOT(!): it is like revarse like if value is true it returns false
Bitwise operators
 it comapares the values bitwise
types operators
1.type of operators : the type of operate used to know the data type of the variable returns the type of variable
2.instance of operators : Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type

string operators : 
    string comparision 
    string concatination (adition)
nullish operator(??): it is the  speail operator newley intrdocued in ES2020
it checks the left hand value is null or undefined than it will returns the right hand value
ternary operator(?):
 it requried three operands and it is checkes frist condition if it is true the frist value return aotherwise it returns second value 

 unary operators
    1.unary plus(+)
    2.unary minus(-)
    3.logical not(!)
    4.delete 
    5.bitwise not(~)
    6.void:Evaluates an expression and returns undefined.
    7.typeof
