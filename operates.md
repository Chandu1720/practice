What is operators and types of operators?
opereators are speial keyword or symbols that performs the opereations on values(oprands)
there differnt types of operators supported by js
 unary binary ternary 
        1.Arthamatic operators
        2.Assignment operators
        3.Comparasion operators
        4.Logical operators
        5.Bitwise operators
        7.typeof operator
        8.string operators
        9.nullish operator
1.Arthamatic operators:
    arthamatic operators performs  arthamatic operations like addition ,subtraction ,multiplication and division and modules
    1.addition(+):it performs  the addtion and retuns the sum of two values
        ex:operand1+operand2
    2.sub(-):It subtracts the right-hand value from the left-hand value and returns the result.
        ex: operand1-operand2
    3.mul(*):it performs mul operation and returns the product of two values
        ex:operand1*operand2
    4.div(/):It divides the left-hand value by the right-hand value and returns the quotient.
        ex:operand1/operand2
    5.modules(%):It returns the remainder after dividing the left-hand value by the right-hand value.
        ex:operand1%operand2
    
    ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
    1. =  Assign it assigns the value to the variables
    2. += it will add and assign
    3. -= it will subtract and assign
    4. *= it will multiply and assign
    5. /= it will dived and assign
    6. %= it will modules and assign

    COMPARASATION OPERATORS : returns only boolean values( true or false)
    1.  == : it means equal to compares both value are equal or not it neglates datatype It performs type coercion 
    2. === : it is same as equal to but it dont performs type coercion but it compares bothvalue and data type
    3. >:it means greterthan it compares the left hand value is greterthan right hand value
    4. <:it means less than it compares the left-hand value is lower than right-hand value
    5. >=it means grerer than equalsto 
    6. <=
    7. !=
    8. !==
